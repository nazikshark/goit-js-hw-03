# GoIT JavaScript Homework #02

This repository contains the second homework assignment for the JavaScript course. The focus of this module is on branching logic, logical operators, string methods, and loops.

## 📋 Project Overview
The assignment consists of four tasks designed to practice:
- Branching with `if...else` statements.
- Conditional selection with the `switch` statement.
- String manipulation (methods like `slice`, `toLowerCase`, `includes`).
- Basic logical operations.

## 🚀 Tasks Description:

### Task 1: Droid Purchase Logic (`task-1.js`)
A function `makeTransaction(quantity, pricePerDroid, customerCredits)` that:
- Calculates the total order cost.
- Checks if the customer has enough credits.
- Returns either a success message or an "Insufficient funds!" warning.

### Task 2: Message Formatting (`task-2.js`)
A function `formatMessage(message, maxLength)` that:
- Checks the length of a string.
- If the string is too long, it truncates it to the specified length and adds an ellipsis ("...").

### Task 3: Spam Detection (`task-3.js`)
A function `checkForSpam(message)` that:
- Performs a case-insensitive check for prohibited words like "spam" and "sale".
- Uses string methods to normalize text for reliable detection.

### Task 4: Shipping Cost Calculation (`task-4.js`)
A function `getShippingCost(country)` that:
- Uses a `switch` statement to provide shipping prices for specific countries (China, Chile, Australia, Jamaica).
- Returns a standardized shipping message or an error if delivery is unavailable.

## 🛠 Technologies Used:
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Prettier (for code formatting)
